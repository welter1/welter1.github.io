    <p>
    I am a junior year Cybersecurity student at the University of Central Arkansas with a minor in Computer Science. My interest in the cybers pace began after my internship with Walmart as a Security Risk and Compliance Analyst within their infoSec department. Before I switched my major I was pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at the University of Arkansas. I've always been fascinated by technology, my initial curiosity began when a friend of mine convinced me to help him get a C++ class started in our highschool. We had a lot of control of the speed of the class and after winter break the class was switched to "self-taught" because we had superseded our teachers understanding of programming (which to be fair she had only taught a basic programing logic class before ours). after that, I knew this was the field I wanted to pursue and decided to work towards a Computer Engineering Degree.<br> 
     <br>

    Switching my major to Cybersecurity did set my graduation date back but I'm positive it will be worth my time. I learned so much about Cybersecurity at my internship over the summer, but there's so much to know in the information security space and I wanted to ensure I comprehended as much as I could. I hope to apply my Computer Engineering, Software Development, and Mathematics skills to the Cybersecurity space to help better secure devices from IoT to Internal company software.

        <p><b></b></p>
        <p> The assignment was to use an Arduino board to design anything we wanted and present it at the end of the semester, the only requirement was that it functioned. The professor told the class that the robot hand had been attempted every year but hadn’t been completed by anyone in the freshman intro to engineering class. My team and I figured that was due to teams over complicating the product, so we gave it a shot.
          <br> We started simply with a toy hand we found online. From there we broke it down and connected the fingers to servo motors using fishing line. Intending to reduce complexity we decided to use Styrofoam for the interior structure due to the fact it was easy to mold and also easy to replace in case of errors in the build. Once we had mapped out the placement of the servos and built our mold, we connected the flex sensors to our glove and adjusted our code to have the robot hand show Realtime reflection of the user’s movements. After we had completed the project and presented, the total cost of the robot hand was 11 dollars. (not including the Arduino kits that were given to us in class) which turned out to be 1/4th the cost of the average previous attempts before us. I learned a lot from this project but most importantly how necessary a good team is when it comes to designing, developing, and implementing a project.</p>

        <br>
      Group Database project to pick an online Database and recreate it, my team and I picked IMDB, we created a database from scratch, starting by laying out our ER and EER diagrams, we then converted the ER diagram to a Relational Database Schema and implemented the data using oracle DDL language. Once the database was complete, we developed queries in Oracle DML to show the functionality of our database. I've included the ER diagram and the Relational Database Schema below. I will be uploading the database to github within a few weeks for anyone intrested in seeing the completed product. </p>

   				<br>
   				Currently, this Portfolio website is accessed through my GitHub account but the initial goal of this website is to show my knowledge in the Cybersecurity space. I'm working on setting up a server to host this page and developing some security regulations to protect it. I'm taking this on step by step in my free time but hope to also create a private network for the server and use a raspberry pi board for some network security/firewall applications. I'm hoping to have this project done before the summer but I've also been studying to get my CEH in my free time.

		In this section, I'm going to include all relevant Courses I've taken, excluding any general education courses. I've decided to split this section into 3 Cybersecurity/Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Mathematics. I'm including my Computer Engineering Courses separately because they did not count towards my major or minor but still Benefited my knowledge greatly when it comes to Cybersecurity and Computer Science.

    				<p>I'm a strong believer in giving credit where credits due, as mentioned in the On-going Projects section this site was made primarily to show my Projects and Cybersecurity skills and not necessarily to show my HTML and CSS skills. In the interest of saving time I decided to use a website template from HTML5up and adjust the code to fit my needs, I added the navigation bar, drop-down capabilities, and stick to top my self. The codes have been changed enough to make it my own but I wanted to express my thanks to HTML5up. If you are interested in comparing my changes to the original HTML feel free to check out their website the original is called Directive.<br>
